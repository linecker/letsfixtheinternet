# Let's fix the internet

On a technical and commercial basis, the internet is working quite well. Apart from that, one could argue that the internet seems rather broken. Cybercrime, fake news, clickbaiting, disinformation campaigns, online profiling, mobile phone addiction â€” isn't that crazy? Many people actually think so.

Inspired by a work project that made me realize how naive I have been concerning my personal use of the internet, I started to dig deeper. I took the "follow the money"-approach and found three main branches of problems, namely profiling, manipulating and attacking.

What you'll find on this site is a growing collection of initiatives, projects and resources that tackle those issues. Do you know another project? Please tell me (via a github pull request or mail to stefan@letsfixtheinternet.org).

## Problems and solutions

### Profiling
#### Problem: ####

Many internet services are free to use but the real price we pay is our personal data. Some of the most valuable internet companies have indeed perfected this.

#### Solutions & Projects: ####
 - Privacy by design (instead of privacy by policy), e.g. https://mega.co.nz/
 - Data protection by design, e.g. https://protonmail.com/
 - Tails Live CD https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html 
 - Tor anonymity network https://www.torproject.org/
 - Firefox Containers 
 - Local-First Softare & Conflict-free Replicated Data Types https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf
 - Tim Bernes Lee Contract for the Web https://contractfortheweb.org/
 - Private cloud, self-hosting
 - Decentralized social networks like https://planetary.social/ https://handbook.scuttlebutt.nz/

### Manipulating
#### Problem: ####

Fake news, targeted disinformation campaigns, clickbaiting, addicting technologies. These are alarming realities, sponsored by both private companies and governments.

#### Solutions & Projects: ####
 - Underlay https://underlay.mit.edu/
 - European Digital Media Observatory
 - Google News Initiative https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/

Both criminal organizations (in the case of ransomware) and governments (in the case of censorship and espionage) use cyberattacks for their purposes.
